    Newton's First Law: A body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless a resultant external force acts on it.
    Newton's Second Law: The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on it and occurs in the direction of the force.

    Frequency, ƒ: The number of complete cycles per second made by the oscillating object.
    Simple Harmonic Motion: The motion of the body whose acceleration is directly proportional to its displacement from equilibrium and is always directed towards equilibrium.
    Resonance: The tendency of a system to oscillate at maximum amplitude at its natural frequency.
    Forced Oscillation: When the system is forced to oscillate at a frequency other than the natural frequency by a periodic external force.
